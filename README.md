## Docker Setup

### Architecture

The application uses Docker containers to provide isolated development environments:

- **One container per project** - Each project runs in its own Docker container
- **Soroban template initialized** - Every new project comes with a working contract template
- **File persistence** - Files are stored within the container and synced with the UI

### Container Management

#### Automatic Creation

When you create a new project:

1. A Docker container is created with a unique name (`project-{id}`)
2. The Soroban contract template is automatically initialized
3. Dependencies are installed (`cargo build`)

#### Container Operations via API

The backend provides API endpoints for container management:

```
POST /api/docker
```

**Available Actions:**

- `createProject` - Create and initialize a new container
- `deleteProject` - Stop and remove a container
- `getFiles` - List all files in a project
- `getFileContent` - Read file content
- `saveFileContent` - Write file content
- `buildProject` - Build the contract
- `deployProject` - Deploy the contract

### Manual Docker Commands (Advanced)

```bash
# View running containers
docker ps

# View all containers
docker ps -a

# View container logs
docker logs <container-name>

# Execute command in container
docker exec <container-name> <command>

# Remove a project container
docker stop <container-name>
docker rm <container-name>
```

### Docker Requirements

- **Docker installed** on your system
- **Docker daemon running** and accessible
- **stellar-sandbox image** available (pre-built or pulled automatically)
- Sufficient disk space for container images and project files

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](./DOCKER_SETUP.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Container not found"

**Problem:** The Docker container for your project is not running or has been deleted.

**Solutions:**

1. Verify Docker is installed and running: `docker ps`
2. Check if the container exists: `docker ps -a`
3. Delete and recreate the project from the Home page

#### Issue: "Build failed" or "Compilation error"

**Problem:** Your contract code has syntax errors or missing dependencies.

**Solutions:**

1. Check the error message in the Terminal panel
2. Review the line number indicated in the error
3. Verify all imports are correct: `use soroban_sdk::...`
4. Check `Cargo.toml` for required dependencies
5. Fix the code and click Build again

#### Issue: "Wallet not connecting"

**Problem:** Cannot connect to Freighter wallet.

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure Freighter extension is installed in your browser
2. Verify the extension is enabled
3. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl + R / Cmd + R)
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Try a different browser or device

#### Issue: "Deploy failed" or insufficient balance

**Problem:** Cannot deploy contract due to insufficient funds.

**Solutions:**

1. Check your wallet balance in the top right corner
2. Ensure you have at least 1 XLM for transaction fees
3. Get testnet XLM from the [Stellar Testnet Faucet](https://stellar.expert/)
4. Wait a few seconds and try deploying again

#### Issue: "Files not saving"

**Problem:** Changes to files are not being persisted.

**Solutions:**

1. Check the Terminal for any error messages
2. Verify the Docker container is still running: `docker ps`
3. Try closing and reopening the file
4. Refresh the page and open the file again
5. Check available disk space on your system

#### Issue: Slow Performance

**Problem:** Editor is running slow or unresponsive.

**Solutions:**

1. Close unnecessary tabs to reduce memory usage
2. Clear browser cache and restart
3. Reduce terminal log history (clear logs)
4. Check available system memory and CPU
5. Try a different browser

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not listed above:

1. **Check the Terminal panel** for detailed error messages
2. **Review the console** (F12 → Console tab) for JavaScript errors
3. **Check Docker logs** for container-related issues:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container-name>
   ```
4. **Restart the application**:
   - Stop the dev server (Ctrl + C)
   - Clear node cache: `rm -rf .next`
   - Restart: `npm run dev`
